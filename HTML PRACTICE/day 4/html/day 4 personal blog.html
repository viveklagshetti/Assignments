          M.S. Dhoni, in full Mahendra Singh Dhoni, (born July 7, 1981, Ranchi,
          Bihar [now Jharkhand] state, India), Indian cricketer whose rise to
          prominence in the early 21st century culminated in his captaincy of
          the Indian national team that won the one-day Cricket World Cup in
          2011.

          Dhoni made his international debut in 2004. His talent with the bat
          came to the fore in an innings of 148 runs against Pakistan in his
          fifth international match. Within a year he joined the India Test
          team, where he quickly established himself with a century (100 or more
          runs in a single innings) against Pakistan. Despite his inexperience,
          Dhoni took over the captaincy of the one-day side in 2007 and led
          India to the Twenty20 (T20) world title. Series wins over Australia
          and Sri Lanka, among others, moved India to the top of the
          International Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings for the first time
          in December 2009. Dhoni was honoured for his play with the ICC One Day
          International Player of the Year Award in 2008 and 2009. In the 2011
          one-day World Cup, Dhoni’s dashing innings of 91 not out—in front of a
          home crowd in Mumbai—paved the way for India’s victory over Sri Lanka
          in the final. He also led India to an appearance in the semifinals of
          the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Dhoni stopped serving as India’s captain
          in 2017, having led his country in 331 international matches, the most
          for a captain in the sport’s history. Three years later he retired
          from international competition.

          The explosion of T20 cricket on the Indian subcontinent paved the way
          for the formation of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008. In the
          league’s inaugural season, Dhoni signed with the Chennai Super Kings
          for $1.5 million, which at the time was the largest contract in the
          IPL. He subsequently led the team to two consecutive titles (2010,
          2011). The Super Kings franchise earned a two-season suspension from
          the IRL in 2016 for its role in a match-fixing scandal, and Dhoni then
          joined the Rising Pune Supergiant. In 2018 he returned to the Chennai
          Super Kings, and the team won the IPL championship that year and in
          2021. Dhoni’s life was the subject of the hit Bollywood film M.S.
          Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016).

      <h1>History</h1>

        <summary style="font-size: larger;"><b>Origin</b></summary>
        <p>
          Cricket is believed to have begun possibly as early as the 13th
          century as a game in which country boys bowled at a tree stump or at
          the hurdle gate into a sheep pen. This gate consisted of two uprights
          and a crossbar resting on the slotted tops; the crossbar was called a
          bail and the entire gate a wicket. The fact that the bail could be
          dislodged when the wicket was struck made this preferable to the
          stump, which name was later applied to the hurdle uprights. Early
          manuscripts differ about the size of the wicket, which acquired a
          third stump in the 1770s, but by 1706 the pitch—the area between the
          wickets—was 22 yards long. The ball, once presumably a stone, has
          remained much the same since the 17th century. Its modern weight of
          between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (156 and 163 grams) was established in
          1774.
